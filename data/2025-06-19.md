Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 建模临床决策过程以支持诊断

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床决策支持中的应用存在两种局限：要么假设所有患者信息立即可用，不模拟交互式和迭代的调查过程；要么限制自己使用大型预训练模型的有限'开箱即用'能力，不进行特定任务的训练

Method: 提出一个假设驱动的不确定性感知语言代理LA-CDM，通过反复请求和解释相关测试来收敛于诊断，采用结合监督学习和强化学习的混合训练范式，针对临床决策制定的三个关键方面进行训练：准确的假设生成、假设不确定性估计和高效决策制定

Result: 在MIMIC-CDM数据集上评估我们的方法，这是一个涵盖四种腹部疾病包含各种临床测试的真实世界数据集，展示了明确训练临床决策制定对于提高诊断性能和效率的好处

Conclusion: 假设驱动的不确定性感知语言代理LA-CDM能够有效支持临床决策过程，提高诊断的准确性和效率

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.

### [4] [机器人上下文协议（RCP）：一种运行时无关的智能体感知机器人控制接口](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11650v1)
*Lambert Lee, Joshua Lau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 设计Robot Context Protocol（RCP）以简化机器人系统的复杂性并实现机器人、用户和自主代理之间的无缝交互

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人系统复杂，需要一种轻量级、中间件无关的通信协议来支持广泛的部署环境，包括物理机器人、基于云的协调器和模拟平台

Method: 基于HTTP和WebSocket传输层，定义了一个模式驱动的消息格式，包含读取、写入、执行和订阅等结构化操作，并集成了运行时自省、异步反馈、多租户命名空间隔离和严格类型验证等功能

Result: RCP的架构、消息结构、接口模型和基于适配器的后端集成策略被描述，同时提供了部署实践和在制造业、物流和医疗保健等行业中的适用性

Conclusion: RCP能够在复杂的多代理生态系统中实现智能、弹性和安全的机器人操作

Abstract: The Robot Context Protocol (RCP) is a lightweight, middleware-agnostic communication protocol designed to simplify the complexity of robotic systems and enable seamless interaction between robots, users, and autonomous agents. RCP provides a unified and semantically meaningful interface that decouples client-facing operations from backend implementations, supporting a wide range of deployment environments including physical robots, cloud-based orchestrators, and simulated platforms. Built on HTTP and WebSocket transport layers, the protocol defines a schema-driven message format with structured operations such as read, write, execute, and subscribe. It integrates features such as runtime introspection, asynchronous feedback, multi-tenant namespace isolation, and strict type validation to ensure robustness, scalability, and security. The architecture, message structure, interface model, and adapter-based backend integration strategy of RCP are described, along with deployment practices and applicability across industries including manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. RCP enables intelligent, resilient, and safe robotic operations in complex, multi-agent ecosystems.

### [1] [统一软件工程代理作为AI软件工程师](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683v1)
*Leonhard Applis, Yuntong Zhang, Shanchao Liang, Nan Jiang, Lin Tan, Abhik Roychoudhury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 理解LLM代理是否等同于AI软件工程师，并开发一个统一的软件工程代理USEagent

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)技术的增长提高了对自动化编码的期望，但软件工程不仅仅是编码，还包括项目的维护和演进等活动

Method: 开发一个统一的软件工程代理USEagent，能够协调和处理多种能力，而不是为特定的软件任务构建专门的代理

Result: 在包含1,271个仓库级软件工程任务的USEbench评估中，USEagent显示出比现有通用代理如OpenHands CodeActAgent更高的效能

Conclusion: USEagent作为未来AI软件工程师的初稿，展示了在涉及AI和人类的未来软件开发团队中作为团队成员的潜力，尽管在某些编码任务上仍存在能力差距

Abstract: The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型软件模型难以整体把握，传统交互和分析方法面临挑战

Method: 研究两种方法：直接提示法和基于LLM的代理与通用文件访问工具结合的代理法

Result: 代理法在准确性上与直接提示法相当，但在令牌使用上显著更高效

Conclusion: 代理法特别适合汽车行业，对于大型软件模型，LLM代理不仅是实用的替代方案，而且是唯一可行的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for interacting with complex software artifacts, such as software models, through natural language. They present especially promising benefits for large software models that are difficult to grasp in their entirety, making traditional interaction and analysis approaches challenging. This paper investigates two approaches for leveraging LLMs to answer questions over software models: direct prompting, where the whole software model is provided in the context, and an agentic approach combining LLM-based agents with general-purpose file access tools. We evaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis and software optimization in automotive and embedded domains. Our findings show that while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct prompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage. This efficiency makes the agentic approach particularly suitable for the automotive industry, where the large size of software models makes direct prompting infeasible, establishing LLM agents as not just a practical alternative but the only viable solution. Notably, the evaluation was conducted using small LLMs, which are more feasible to be executed locally - an essential advantage for meeting strict requirements around privacy, intellectual property protection, and regulatory compliance. Future work will investigate software models in diverse formats, explore more complex agent architectures, and extend agentic workflows to support not only querying but also modification of software models.
