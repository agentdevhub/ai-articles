Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发能够流畅桥接实体化和网络规模推理的AI代理新范式

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理大多孤立，要么检索和推理在线获取的大量数字信息和知识，要么通过实体感知、规划和行动与物理世界互动，但很少同时进行两者，这限制了它们解决需要整合物理和数字智能的任务的能力

Method: 首先开发了Embodied Web Agents任务环境，一个统一的模拟平台，将现实的3D室内外环境与功能性网络接口紧密集成；在此基础上，构建并发布了Embodied Web Agents Benchmark，包含多样化的任务套件，如烹饪、导航、购物、旅游和地理定位，所有这些任务都需要跨物理和数字领域的协调推理，以系统评估跨领域智能

Result: 实验结果显示，最先进的AI系统与人类能力之间存在显著的性能差距，为实体认知和网络规模知识访问的交叉领域既提出了挑战，也提供了机会

Conclusion: 所有数据集、代码和网站都在我们的项目页面https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/上公开可用

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

### [2] [《SwarmAgentic：基于群体智能的全自动化代理系统生成研究》](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15672v1)
*Yao Zhang, Chenyang Lin, Shijie Tang, Haokun Chen, Shijie Zhou, Yunpu Ma, Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SwarmAgentic框架以实现完全自动化的代理系统生成

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统生成框架缺乏完全自主性，限制了适应性和可扩展性

Method: 通过语言驱动的探索，从零开始构建代理系统，并通过反馈引导的更新进化候选系统群体

Result: 在六个现实世界的开放性和探索性任务中，SwarmAgentic在所有基线上表现优异，特别是在TravelPlanner基准上实现了+261.8%的相对改进

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic框架标志着向可扩展和自主代理系统设计迈出了重要一步，将群体智能与完全自动化的系统多代理生成相结合

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates, drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is publicly released at https://yaoz720.github.io/SwarmAgentic/.

### [5] [替身攻击法：基于提示的可迁移对抗攻击打破大语言模型智能体的角色一致性](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14539v1)
*Daewon Kang, YeongHwan Shin, Doyeon Kim, Kyu-Hwan Jung, Meong Hi Son*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型在提示工程下的安全性、鲁棒性和行为一致性

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示工程的便利性引发了关于底层提示的安全性、鲁棒性和行为一致性的紧迫担忧，以及防止这些提示暴露于用户尝试的挑战

Method: 提出'Doppelgänger方法'来展示代理被劫持的风险，定义'Prompt Alignment Collapse under Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)'级别来评估对这种对抗性转移攻击的脆弱性，并提出'Caution for Adversarial Transfer (CAT)'提示来对抗Doppelgänger方法

Result: 实验结果表明，Doppelgänger方法可以破坏代理的一致性并暴露其内部信息，而CAT提示能够有效防御这种对抗性攻击

Conclusion: CAT提示是防御对抗性转移攻击的有效方法

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models, prompt engineering now enables the rapid, low-effort creation of diverse autonomous agents that are already in widespread use. Yet this convenience raises urgent concerns about the safety, robustness, and behavioral consistency of the underlying prompts, along with the pressing challenge of preventing those prompts from being exposed to user's attempts. In this paper, we propose the ''Doppelg\"anger method'' to demonstrate the risk of an agent being hijacked, thereby exposing system instructions and internal information. Next, we define the ''Prompt Alignment Collapse under Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)'' level to evaluate the vulnerability to this adversarial transfer attack. We also propose a ''Caution for Adversarial Transfer (CAT)'' prompt to counter the Doppelg\"anger method. The experimental results demonstrate that the Doppelg\"anger method can compromise the agent's consistency and expose its internal information. In contrast, CAT prompts enable effective defense against this adversarial attack.

### [10] [终身社交智能评估：语言代理在长期社会互动中的表现研究](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12666v1)
*Hitesh Goel, Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 评估语言代理在终身社交互动中的社交智能

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未充分探讨AI系统是否能够像人类一样通过长期社交互动收集信息并有效导航各种社交情境

Method: 提出新基准LIFELONG-SOTOPIA，通过模拟多集互动对语言代理进行全面评估

Result: 发现所有测试的语言模型的目标达成度和可信度在整个互动过程中下降，尽管使用先进记忆方法提高了代理性能，但在需要明确理解互动历史的情境中，最佳代理的目标完成率仍显著低于人类

Conclusion: LIFELONG-SOTOPIA可用于评估语言代理在终身社交互动中的社交智能

Abstract: Humans engage in lifelong social interactions through interacting with different people under different scenarios for different social goals. This requires social intelligence to gather information through a long time span and use it to navigate various social contexts effectively. Whether AI systems are also capable of this is understudied in the existing research. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark, LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, to perform a comprehensive evaluation of language agents by simulating multi-episode interactions. In each episode, the language agents role-play characters to achieve their respective social goals in randomly sampled social tasks. With LIFELONG-SOTOPIA, we find that goal achievement and believability of all of the language models that we test decline through the whole interaction. Although using an advanced memory method improves the agents' performance, the best agents still achieve a significantly lower goal completion rate than humans on scenarios requiring an explicit understanding of interaction history. These findings show that we can use LIFELONG-SOTOPIA to evaluate the social intelligence of language agents over lifelong social interactions.

### [8] [基于强化学习的假设驱动临床决策语言智能体](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13474v1)
*David Bani-Harouni, Chantal Pellegrini, Ege Özsoy, Matthias Keicher, Nassir Navab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 建模临床决策过程以支持诊断

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床决策支持中的应用存在两种局限：要么假设所有患者信息立即可用，不模拟交互式和迭代的调查过程；要么仅限于大型预训练模型的'开箱即用'能力，不进行任务特定训练

Method: 提出一个假设驱动的不确定性感知语言代理LA-CDM，通过反复请求和解释相关测试来收敛于诊断，采用结合监督学习和强化学习的混合训练范式，针对临床决策制定的三个关键方面进行训练：准确假设生成、假设不确定性估计和高效决策制定

Result: 在MIMIC-CDM真实世界数据集上评估方法，该数据集涵盖四种腹部疾病和各种临床测试，显示明确训练临床决策制定对提高诊断性能和效率的益处

Conclusion: 假设驱动的不确定性感知语言代理LA-CDM能有效支持临床决策过程，提高诊断性能和效率

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 开发一个可配置的工作流程StreetLens，用于自动化邻里环境评估

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统邻里研究方法耗时且需要专家密集干预，现有技术方法缺乏跨研究设计和地理环境的适应性

Method: 提出StreetLens，一个以人为中心、研究者可配置的工作流程，将社会科学专业知识嵌入视觉语言模型(VLM)中，用于可扩展的邻里环境评估

Result: StreetLens通过从既定访谈协议中提取问题、检索相关街景图像(SVI)并生成从客观特征到主观感知的广泛语义注释，模仿了训练有素的人类编码员的过程

Conclusion: StreetLens代表了向灵活、主动的AI系统的转变，这些系统与研究人员紧密合作，加速和扩展邻里研究

Abstract: Traditionally, neighborhood studies have employed interviews, surveys, and manual image annotation guided by detailed protocols to identify environmental characteristics, including physical disorder, decay, street safety, and sociocultural symbols, and to examine their impact on developmental and health outcomes. While these methods yield rich insights, they are time-consuming and require intensive expert intervention. Recent technological advances, including vision-language models (VLMs), have begun to automate parts of this process; however, existing efforts are often ad hoc and lack adaptability across research designs and geographic contexts. In this demo paper, we present StreetLens, a human-centered, researcher-configurable workflow that embeds relevant social science expertise in a VLM for scalable neighborhood environmental assessments. StreetLens mimics the process of trained human coders by grounding the analysis in questions derived from established interview protocols, retrieving relevant street view imagery (SVI), and generating a wide spectrum of semantic annotations from objective features (e.g., the number of cars) to subjective perceptions (e.g., the sense of disorder in an image). By enabling researchers to define the VLM's role through domain-informed prompting, StreetLens places domain knowledge at the core of the analysis process. It also supports the integration of prior survey data to enhance robustness and expand the range of characteristics assessed across diverse settings. We provide a Google Colab notebook to make StreetLens accessible and extensible for researchers working with public or custom SVI datasets. StreetLens represents a shift toward flexible, agentic AI systems that work closely with researchers to accelerate and scale neighborhood studies.

### [7] [Spec2RTL-Agent：基于LLM智能体系统的复杂硬件规范自动代码生成](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13905v1)
*Zhongzhi Yu, Mingjie Liu, Michael Zimmer, Yingyan Celine Lin, Yong Liu, Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出Spec2RTL-Agent系统，旨在直接从复杂的规范文档生成对应的RTL代码实现，推动基于LLM的RTL代码生成向更现实的应用场景迈进

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解决方案在实际应用场景和真实世界RTL代码开发需求之间存在显著差距，限制了其可扩展性和自动化潜力

Method: 引入一个新颖的多智能体协作框架，集成了三个关键促成因素：推理和理解模块、渐进式编码和提示优化模块、自适应反射模块

Result: 在三个规范文档上评估Spec2RTL-Agent，显示其生成的RTL代码比现有方法减少了高达75%的人工干预

Conclusion: Spec2RTL-Agent作为第一个从非结构化规范完全自动化的多智能体系统，减少了硬件设计中的人力依赖

Abstract: Despite recent progress in generating hardware RTL code with LLMs, existing solutions still suffer from a substantial gap between practical application scenarios and the requirements of real-world RTL code development. Prior approaches either focus on overly simplified hardware descriptions or depend on extensive human guidance to process complex specifications, limiting their scalability and automation potential. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an LLM agent system, termed Spec2RTL-Agent, designed to directly process complex specification documentation and generate corresponding RTL code implementations, advancing LLM-based RTL code generation toward more realistic application settings. To achieve this goal, Spec2RTL-Agent introduces a novel multi-agent collaboration framework that integrates three key enablers: (1) a reasoning and understanding module that translates specifications into structured, step-by-step implementation plans; (2) a progressive coding and prompt optimization module that iteratively refines the code across multiple representations to enhance correctness and synthesisability for RTL conversion; and (3) an adaptive reflection module that identifies and traces the source of errors during generation, ensuring a more robust code generation flow. Instead of directly generating RTL from natural language, our system strategically generates synthesizable C++ code, which is then optimized for HLS. This agent-driven refinement ensures greater correctness and compatibility compared to naive direct RTL generation approaches. We evaluate Spec2RTL-Agent on three specification documents, showing it generates accurate RTL code with up to 75% fewer human interventions than existing methods. This highlights its role as the first fully automated multi-agent system for RTL generation from unstructured specs, reducing reliance on human effort in hardware design.

TL;DR: 提升胸部X光（CXR）成像在胸部疾病诊断中的自动化系统的病理覆盖范围、诊断准确性以及视觉和文本推理的整合能力

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动化系统在病理覆盖范围、诊断准确性和视觉与文本推理整合方面存在局限

Method: 提出RadFabric，一个多代理、多模态推理框架，基于模型上下文协议（MCP）构建，实现模块化、互操作性和可扩展性，整合新的诊断代理

Result: RadFabric在挑战性病理如骨折的检测上达到近乎完美的准确度（1.000），整体诊断准确性（0.799）显著优于传统系统（0.229至0.527）

Conclusion: 通过整合跨模态特征对齐和偏好驱动的推理，RadFabric推动了AI驱动的放射学向透明、解剖学精确和临床可操作的CXR分析迈进

Abstract: Chest X ray (CXR) imaging remains a critical diagnostic tool for thoracic conditions, but current automated systems face limitations in pathology coverage, diagnostic accuracy, and integration of visual and textual reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose RadFabric, a multi agent, multimodal reasoning framework that unifies visual and textual analysis for comprehensive CXR interpretation. RadFabric is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling modularity, interoperability, and scalability for seamless integration of new diagnostic agents. The system employs specialized CXR agents for pathology detection, an Anatomical Interpretation Agent to map visual findings to precise anatomical structures, and a Reasoning Agent powered by large multimodal reasoning models to synthesize visual, anatomical, and clinical data into transparent and evidence based diagnoses. RadFabric achieves significant performance improvements, with near-perfect detection of challenging pathologies like fractures (1.000 accuracy) and superior overall diagnostic accuracy (0.799) compared to traditional systems (0.229 to 0.527). By integrating cross modal feature alignment and preference-driven reasoning, RadFabric advances AI-driven radiology toward transparent, anatomically precise, and clinically actionable CXR analysis.

TL;DR: 将被动人类反馈整合到自主代理训练中的隐式人机交互强化学习（HITL-RL）方法

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖主动指令，要求参与者通过不自然的表达或手势教导代理

Method: 引入NEURO-LOOP框架，利用内在人类奖励系统驱动人机交互，并使用功能性近红外光谱（fNIRS）设计数据集

Result: 使用经典机器学习技术证实了fNIRS数据与代理性能之间存在关系

Conclusion: 神经接口可能为未来的人机交互、辅助AI和自适应自主系统应用提供潜力

Abstract: Implicit Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HITL-RL) is a methodology that integrates passive human feedback into autonomous agent training while minimizing human workload. However, existing methods often rely on active instruction, requiring participants to teach an agent through unnatural expression or gesture. We introduce NEURO-LOOP, an implicit feedback framework that utilizes the intrinsic human reward system to drive human-agent interaction. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a critical first step in the NEURO-LOOP framework: mapping brain signals to agent performance. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we design a dataset to enable future research using passive Brain-Computer Interfaces for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning. Participants are instructed to observe or guide a reinforcement learning agent in its environment while signals from the prefrontal cortex are collected. We conclude that a relationship between fNIRS data and agent performance exists using classical machine learning techniques. Finally, we highlight the potential that neural interfaces may offer to future applications of human-agent interaction, assistive AI, and adaptive autonomous systems.

*Leonhard Applis, Yuntong Zhang, Shanchao Liang, Nan Jiang, Lin Tan, Abhik Roychoudhury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 理解LLM代理是否等同于AI软件工程师，并开发一个统一的软件工程代理（USEagent）

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）技术的增长提高了对自动化编码的期望，但软件工程不仅仅是编码，还包括项目的维护和演进等活动

Method: 开发一个统一的软件工程代理（USEagent），能够协调和处理多种能力，而不是为特定的软件任务构建专门的代理

Result: 在包含1,271个仓库级软件工程任务的USEbench评估中，USEagent显示出比现有通用代理（如OpenHands CodeActAgent）更高的效能

Conclusion: USEagent作为未来AI软件工程师的初稿，展示了在涉及AI和人类的未来软件开发团队中作为团队成员的潜力，尽管在某些编码任务上仍存在能力差距

Abstract: The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding. However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）回答关于软件模型的问题

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型软件模型难以整体把握，传统交互和分析方法面临挑战

Method: 研究两种方法：直接提示法和基于LLM的代理与通用文件访问工具结合的代理法

Result: 代理法在准确性上与直接提示法相当，但在令牌使用上显著更高效

Conclusion: 代理法特别适合汽车行业，对于大型软件模型，LLM代理不仅是实用的替代方案，而且是唯一可行的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for interacting with complex software artifacts, such as software models, through natural language. They present especially promising benefits for large software models that are difficult to grasp in their entirety, making traditional interaction and analysis approaches challenging. This paper investigates two approaches for leveraging LLMs to answer questions over software models: direct prompting, where the whole software model is provided in the context, and an agentic approach combining LLM-based agents with general-purpose file access tools. We evaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis and software optimization in automotive and embedded domains. Our findings show that while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct prompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage. This efficiency makes the agentic approach particularly suitable for the automotive industry, where the large size of software models makes direct prompting infeasible, establishing LLM agents as not just a practical alternative but the only viable solution. Notably, the evaluation was conducted using small LLMs, which are more feasible to be executed locally - an essential advantage for meeting strict requirements around privacy, intellectual property protection, and regulatory compliance. Future work will investigate software models in diverse formats, explore more complex agent architectures, and extend agentic workflows to support not only querying but also modification of software models.
