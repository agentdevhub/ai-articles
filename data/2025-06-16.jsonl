Unlike traditional web\nresources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state,\nspawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding\nmillisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic\nbehavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes\nwhether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry\narchitectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS\npropagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation\nunable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate\nfor agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2)\nSwitch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband\ntransitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not\nincremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment,\nclean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for\nadoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized\nregistries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases."}

The recent emergence of Foundation Models\n(FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general\nknowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for\nfurther transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper\nintroduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by\nagentic AI systems.

This position paper questions\nwhether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems\nstill have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the\nactual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based\nHuman-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing\nthem. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and\nmaintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking\nat examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how\nhuman-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We\nalso discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer\npractical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be\nmeasured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with\nhumans.

However, prior work\nhas predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks\nand single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to\ncompositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This\nwork introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile\nagents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,\nContext Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in\n20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online\nChinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates\nwith an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a\nrange of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that\nUI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents\ngenerally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting\nrepresentative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and\nattention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.\nInspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient\nscheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS\nextrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing\nlong-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS\nachieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on\ncompositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without\nsignificantly sacrificing inference overhead.

Building upon this\nframework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic\nagent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that\nthis critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario.

In particular, we design a\nlayered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level\nsemantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the\nsimulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability,\nminimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world\ndistributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained\ngenerative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the\ntraining and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines.

In order to address\nthis gap, we introduce $\\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:\n  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both\nagent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that\ntests both agent coordination and communication,\n  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse,\nverifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and\ncontrolled complexity,\n  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose\nbehavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation\nfidelity,\n  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations\nincluding separating errors arising from reasoning vs\ncommunication/coordination.\n  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents\nshift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding\nusers.
