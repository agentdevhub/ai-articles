This encourages the\nemergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how\nshould a LLM interact with external services, such as \\api and data. However,\nas MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces\nnew safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are\nnot controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party\nMCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic\nincentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In\nthis position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay\nclose attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop\nnew techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our\nposition, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \\framework, a\ncontrolled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2)\nWe then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks\nin MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial.\n(3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered\nagent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the\nfollowing research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP\nsafety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP\nsafe ecosystem construction. We hope this position paper can raise the\nawareness of the research community in MCP safety and encourage more\nresearchers to join this important research direction.

We use Perfect\nBayesian Nash Equilibrium (PBNE) as our solution concept and propose a\ncomputationally efficient approach to find it.

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this\nprocess, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer\nfrom one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of\nimmediate availability of all patient information and do not model the\ninteractive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to\nthe limited \"out-of-the-box\" capabilities of large pre-trained models without\nperforming task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model\nclinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven\nuncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis\nvia repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid\ntraining paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train\nLA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical\ndecision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty\nestimation, and efficient decision-making.

We\nevaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis\nand software optimization in automotive and embedded domains. Our findings show\nthat while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct\nprompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage. This\nefficiency makes the agentic approach particularly suitable for the automotive\nindustry, where the large size of software models makes direct prompting\ninfeasible, establishing LLM agents as not just a practical alternative but the\nonly viable solution. Notably, the evaluation was conducted using small LLMs,\nwhich are more feasible to be executed locally - an essential advantage for\nmeeting strict requirements around privacy, intellectual property protection,\nand regulatory compliance.

This paper presents an agentic system\narchitecture that leverages the model context protocol (MCP) to orchestrate\nmulti-agent collaboration among scientific tools for autonomous,\nsimulation-informed optimization in urban logistics. The system integrates\ngenerative AI agents with domain-specific engines - such as Gurobi for\noptimization and AnyLogic for agent-based simulation - forming a generative\ndigital twin capable of reasoning, planning, and acting across multimodal\nfreight networks. By incorporating integrated chatbots, retrieval-augmented\ngeneration, and structured memory, the framework enables agents to interpret\nuser intent from natural language conversations, retrieve relevant datasets and\nmodels, coordinate solvers and simulators, and execute complex workflows. We\ndemonstrate this approach through a freight decarbonization case study,\nshowcasing how MCP enables modular, interoperable, and adaptive agent behavior\nacross diverse toolchains. The results reveal that our system transforms\ndigital twins from static visualizations into autonomous, decision-capable\nsystems, advancing the frontiers of urban operations research.

We perform\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning, treating each agent as a vulnerable\nhomeostat charged with maintaining its own well-being. We introduce an\nempathy-like mechanism to share homeostatic states between agents: an agent can\neither \\emph{observe} their partner's internal state ({\\bf cognitive empathy})\nor the agent's internal state can be \\emph{directly coupled} to that of their\npartner ({\\bf affective empathy}). In three simple multi-agent environments, we\nshow that prosocial behavior arises only under homeostatic coupling - when the\ndistress of a partner can affect one's own well-being. Additionally, we show\nthat empathy can be learned: agents can ``decode\" their partner's external\nemotive states to infer the partner's internal homeostatic states. Assuming\nsome level of physiological similarity, agents reference their own\nemotion-generation functions to invert the mapping from outward display to\ninternal state. Overall, we demonstrate the emergence of prosocial behavior\nwhen homeostatic agents learn to ``read\" the emotions of others and then to\nempathize, or feel as they feel."}
