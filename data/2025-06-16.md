### [7] [《协作智能的呼唤：为何人机系统应优先于人工智能自主性》](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09420v1)
*Henry Peng Zou, Wei-Chieh Huang, Yaozu Wu, Chunyu Miao, Dongyuan Li, Aiwei Liu, Yue Zhou, Yankai Chen, Weizhi Zhang, Yangning Li, Liancheng Fang, Renhe Jiang, Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否应该朝着完全自主的AI代理方向发展

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主系统在可靠性、透明度和理解人类实际需求方面仍存在问题

Method: 提出基于LLM的人-代理系统（LLM-HAS），通过保持人类的参与来提供指导、回答问题和维持控制

Result: 通过医疗、金融和软件开发等领域的例子展示了人-AI团队合作比AI单独工作更能处理复杂任务

Conclusion: AI的进步不应以系统的独立性来衡量，而应以它们与人类合作的能力来衡量；AI最有前途的未来不在于接管人类角色，而在于通过有意义的合作增强人类能力

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful partnership.

### [11] [$τ^2$-Bench：双控环境下对话智能体的评估](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07982v1)
*Victor Barres, Honghua Dong, Soham Ray, Xujie Si, Karthik Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 引入τ²-bench以解决现有对话AI代理基准测试中用户被动参与的问题

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试模拟单控制环境，与用户需要主动参与修改共享世界状态的真实场景（如技术支持）不符

Method: 1) 将电信双控制领域建模为Dec-POMDP，代理和用户都使用工具在共享动态环境中行动；2) 使用组合任务生成器从原子组件程序化创建多样、可验证的任务；3) 开发与环境紧密耦合的可靠用户模拟器；4) 通过多方面的消融分析对代理性能进行细粒度分析

Result: 实验显示，当代理从无用户控制转向双控制时，性能显著下降，突显了引导用户的挑战

Conclusion: τ²-bench为必须有效推理并引导用户行动的代理提供了一个受控的测试平台

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world, while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:   1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that tests both agent coordination and communication,   2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse, verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and controlled complexity,   3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation fidelity,   4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations including separating errors arising from reasoning vs communication/coordination.   In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

### [8] [面向移动智能体的原子到组合泛化：新基准与调度系统](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08972v1)
*Yuan Guo, Tingjia Miao, Zheng Wu, Pengzhou Cheng, Ming Zhou, Zhuosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估移动代理在组合操作任务上的性能，并提出解决方案以缩小原子任务到组合任务的泛化差距

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作主要集中于原子任务，忽视了组合任务在现实世界应用中的不可或缺性

Method: 引入UI-NEXUS基准测试，支持在20个完全可控的本地实用应用环境和30个在线中英文服务应用中进行交互式评估，并提出AGENT-NEXUS，一个轻量级高效的调度系统

Result: AGENT-NEXUS在UI-NEXUS基准测试中为现有移动代理在组合操作任务上实现了24%到40%的任务成功率提升，且未显著增加推理开销

Conclusion: AGENT-NEXUS通过动态分解长视野任务为一系列自包含的原子子任务，有效提升了移动代理处理组合任务的能力

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation, Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in 20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap. Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code are available on the project page at https://ui-nexus.github.io.

### [9] [改进型大语言模型代理在金融文档问答中的应用](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08726v1)
*Nelvin Tan, Zian Seng, Liang Zhang, Yu-Ching Shih, Dong Yang, Amol Salunkhe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提升大型语言模型在包含表格和文本数据的金融文档数值问答任务中的表现

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在金融文档的数值问答任务中表现不佳，尤其是在没有正确答案（oracle labels）的情况下，传统的批评代理（critic agent）性能下降

Method: 提出了改进的批评代理和计算器代理（calculator agent），并研究了这些代理之间的互动及其对性能的影响

Result: 改进的批评代理和计算器代理在性能上超越了之前的最先进方法（program-of-thought），并且更安全

Conclusion: 改进的批评代理和计算器代理能有效提升大型语言模型在金融文档数值问答任务中的表现，特别是在没有正确答案的情况下

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e., self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought) and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型（FMs），特别是大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现，展示了基于知识的通用推理能力，为工程设计的进一步转型开辟了新路径

Method: 回顾智能设计的历史演变，提出ID 4.0的概念框架，并讨论其通过协调、自主的多代理系统支持工程设计过程端到端自动化的潜力

Result: 提出了ID 4.0的概念框架，并讨论了其在支持工程设计过程端到端自动化方面的潜力

Conclusion: 这些见解为推进智能设计朝着更大的适应性、自主性和有效性，以应对日益复杂的设计挑战奠定了基础

Abstract: Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of multi-agent collaboration. We propose a conceptual framework for ID 4.0 and discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems. Furthermore, we discuss future perspectives to enhance and fully realize ID 4.0's potential, including more complex design scenarios, more practical design implementations, novel agent coordination mechanisms, and autonomous design goal-setting with better human value alignment. In sum, these insights lay a foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity, autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing increasingly complex design challenges.

### [5] [多智能体大语言模型系统的规范与评估——原型设计与网络安全应用](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10467v2)
*Felix Härer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 探索基于LLM的多智能体系统在特定领域应用的潜力

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs、推理技术和应用单独评估较多，但它们的联合规范和组合应用尚未充分探索

Method: 通过多智能体系统进行探索性研究，扩展系统架构和原型，并引入多智能体系统的规范

Result: 测试案例表明，涉及网络安全任务的架构和评估方法是可行的，特别是OpenAI和DeepSeek的LLMs智能体正确完成了问答、服务器安全和网络安全任务

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM系统的规范对于探索其潜力及特定应用的适用性是必要的

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g., through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents. However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification and combined application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system. The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering, server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提升大规模视频生成模型的元素级可控性，以支持场景编辑和具身AI代理训练

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模视频生成模型在动态世界创建中能合成多样且真实的视觉内容，但缺乏元素级的可控性，限制了其在场景编辑和具身AI代理训练中的应用

Method: 提出Dreamland混合世界生成框架，结合基于物理的模拟器的精细控制和大型预训练生成模型的光真实内容输出，设计分层世界抽象作为中间表示

Result: 实验表明Dreamland在图像质量上比现有基线提高了50.8%，在可控性上提高了17.9%，并具有增强具身代理训练的巨大潜力

Conclusion: Dreamland框架通过结合物理模拟器和生成模型的优势，显著提升了视频生成的可控性和实用性

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.

Result: 分析表明，混合方法将出现，关键代理使用集中注册表，专业用例使用联合网状结构

Conclusion: 代理需求构成质的变化，而非增量变化，混合方法在兼容性和性能之间提供了平衡

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state, spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2) Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment, clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

Motivation: 为了应对机器人系统复杂性和实现不同部署环境下无缝交互的挑战

Method: 基于HTTP和WebSocket传输层，定义了一个模式驱动的消息格式，包括读取、写入、执行和订阅等结构化操作，并集成了运行时自省、异步反馈、多租户命名空间隔离和严格类型验证等特性

Result: RCP提供了一个统一且语义上有意义的接口，解耦了客户端操作和后端实现，支持包括物理机器人、基于云的协调器和模拟平台在内的广泛部署环境

Conclusion: RCP在复杂多代理生态系统中实现了智能、弹性和安全的机器人操作

Abstract: The Robot Context Protocol (RCP) is a lightweight, middleware-agnostic communication protocol designed to simplify the complexity of robotic systems and enable seamless interaction between robots, users, and autonomous agents. RCP provides a unified and semantically meaningful interface that decouples client-facing operations from backend implementations, supporting a wide range of deployment environments including physical robots, cloud-based orchestrators, and simulated platforms. Built on HTTP and WebSocket transport layers, the protocol defines a schema-driven message format with structured operations such as read, write, execute, and subscribe. It integrates features such as runtime introspection, asynchronous feedback, multi-tenant namespace isolation, and strict type validation to ensure robustness, scalability, and security. The architecture, message structure, interface model, and adapter-based backend integration strategy of RCP are described, along with deployment practices and applicability across industries including manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. RCP enables intelligent, resilient, and safe robotic operations in complex, multi-agent ecosystems.

Abstract: Following the successful paradigm shift of large language models, leveraging pre-training on a massive corpus of data and fine-tuning on different downstream tasks, generalist models have made their foray into computer vision. The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature, followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future directions concerning synthetic data, early fusion, lessons learnt from generalist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI, and clinical translation.
