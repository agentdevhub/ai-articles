However, software engineering is more than coding and is\nconcerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In\nthis context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs\nas reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent\nthe same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this\nquestion by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike\nexisting work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such\nas testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which\ncan orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the\npromise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an\nincomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others.\nWe envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which\ncan be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and\nhumans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software\nEngineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding,\ntesting, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing\nbenchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on\nUSEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks,\nUSEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as\nOpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for\ncertain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI\nSoftware Engineer of the future.", "title_zh": "统一软件工程代理作为AI软件工程师", "AI": {"task": "理解LLM代理是否等同于AI软件工程师，并开发一个统一的软件工程代理USEagent", "motivation": "大型语言模型(LLM)技术的增长提高了对自动化编码的期望，但软件工程不仅仅是编码，还包括项目的维护和演进等活动", "method": "开发一个统一的软件工程代理USEagent，能够协调和处理多种能力，而不是为特定的软件任务构建专门的代理", "result": "在包含1,271个仓库级软件工程任务的USEbench评估中，USEagent显示出比现有通用代理如OpenHands CodeActAgent更高的效能", "conclusion": "USEagent作为未来AI软件工程师的初稿，展示了在涉及AI和人类的未来软件开发团队中作为团队成员的潜力，尽管在某些编码任务上仍存在能力差距"}}

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this\nprocess, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer\nfrom one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of\nimmediate availability of all patient information and do not model the\ninteractive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to\nthe limited \"out-of-the-box\" capabilities of large pre-trained models without\nperforming task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model\nclinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven\nuncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis\nvia repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid\ntraining paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train\nLA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical\ndecision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty\nestimation, and efficient decision-making.

We\nevaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis\nand software optimization in automotive and embedded domains. Our findings show\nthat while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct\nprompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage.
